## Get Started

1. Create a Pull Request with your proposed changes, and please explain why these changes are useful.
    * This is great if it's a small change. If you have something complex to offer or suggest, please discuss this over an Issue first.

    * Have a look at the codebase for examples about creating unit tests.
